# Imran Amietov - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
My name is Imran and I am pursuing a career in data analytics.

Over the past few years, I have been actively learning about data analytics through various specialized courses. These programs allowed me to master tools and technologies such as SQL, Excel/Google Sheets, as well as data visualization using Power BI and Tableau. Working on projects as part of my studies, I gained practical experience in data processing, analysis and reporting for informed decision making.

My higher medical education gave me a deep understanding of the systemic approach to problem solving, information analysis and working with large volumes of data, which became an excellent foundation for my development in a new field.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
